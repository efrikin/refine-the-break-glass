>Monitoring of the usage of the keys has revealed that typically [about 90% of
the authorized keys are unused.]{style="color:red;"}
That is, they are access credentials that were provisioned years ago, the need
for which ceased to exist or the person having the private key left, and the
authorized key was never deprovisioned. Thus, the access was not terminated when
the need for it ceased to exist.\
\...\
In many organizations – even very security-conscious organizations – there are
many times more obsolete authorized keys than they have employees. Worse,
authorized keys generally grant command-line shell access, which in itself is
often considered privileged. We have found that in many organizations [about 10%
of the authorized keys grant root or administrator access. SSH keys never
expire.]{style="color:red;"}  -- Tatu Ylonen [^tatu]

>Historically, most organizations have [not touched the location of the
authorized keys files.]{style="color:red;"} This means they are in each user's
home directory, and [each user can configure additional permanent credentials
for themselves and their friends.]{style="color:red;"} They can also add
[additional permanent credentials for any service account or
root]{style="color:red;"} account they are able to log into. This has lead to
massive problems in large organizations around managing SSH keys.\
\...\
Enterprises should also pay attention to the AuthorizedKeysCommand and
AuthorizedKeysCommandUser options. They are typically used when SELinux is
enabled and to fetch SSH keys from LDAP directories or other data sources.
[Their use can make auditing SSH keys cumbersome and they can be used to hide
backdoor keys from casual observation.]{style="color:red;"}
